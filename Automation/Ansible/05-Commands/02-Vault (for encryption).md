# 02-Vault (for encryption)

- We use encryption because if there are usernames or passwords files and we will upload it to GitHub, we donâ€™t want GitHub to see them just ansible will see them during running the playbook
- Vault password files are used for automation, but it must be hidden or encrypted too, so in pipeline we put these files in credentials

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt [file] -> to encrypt the file 
# if there are variables in the file we can call it by using {{  }} like any variable
# and ansible will see it in running the playbook

ansible-vault decrypt [file] -> to decrypt the file 

ansible-vault view [file] --> to view the file without decryption

ansible-vault edit [file] -> to edit the file without decryption

```

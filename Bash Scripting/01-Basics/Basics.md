# Basics

```bash
to excute the file we write ./[path of file]
#!/bin/bash --> first line in file including '#' --> **shebang**
#!/bin/sh --> more general than bash 
 
echo "" -> for output 

read --> to take input 
-p "output" input --> to show output before taking input in one line 
# don't forget to give x permisson to file
# can take more than one input 
```
